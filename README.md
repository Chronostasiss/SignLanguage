Overview

The 'Transforming Sign Language using CNN Approach' project aims to develop an accurate and efficient sign language recognition system for Indonesian Sign Language (Bahasa Isyarat Indonesia or BISINDO) utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project addresses the communication barriers faced by the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by translating sign language into written language, thereby enhancing accessibility and inclusion.
Background

More than two million deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals in Indonesia rely on BISINDO as their primary means of communication. However, the general public's limited comprehension of sign language creates communication barriers in their daily lives. Sign language translation technology has the potential to bridge this communication gap by translating sign language into written language.
Purpose

The purpose of this project is to empower the deaf community and facilitate effective communication by developing a precise and effective sign language recognition system for BISINDO. The project utilizes CNNs, a potent machine learning technique that has demonstrated promising results in image and video recognition tasks, including sign language recognition.
Dataset

The project utilizes the BISINDO dataset from Kaggle, which has been previously curated in the study 'Towards Classification of Personality Prediction Model: A Combination of BERT Word Embedding and MLSMOTE.' The dataset contains sign language video data necessary for training and evaluating the CNN-based sign language recognition model.
Approach

The primary approach involves training a CNN model to learn spatial features from sign language video data. CNNs can automatically extract meaningful features from images and video frames, making them ideal for sign language recognition tasks. The project investigates the effectiveness of CNN in translating BISINDO into written language, with the goal of creating a robust and accurate sign language recognition model.
Methodology

The project follows a systematic methodology, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization. The CNN-based approach is compared with alternative methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, to assess performance and effectiveness.


Usage

    Data Preparation: Prepare the BISINDO dataset containing sign language video data.
    Model Training: Train the CNN model using the prepared dataset.
    Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
    Optimization: Fine-tune the model parameters and architecture for better performance if necessary.
